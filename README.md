If passing friends see that, I hope you leave your precious thumb up (circle of friends), if it is a computer friend, can get your precious favor, open the VPN in the busy to leave your little star I will be honored to drown ~ well well so much, in line with the great open source spirit of the Internet, if you also use this textbook in the future and feel a headache because of too rich content (all in all, this is a good textbook that is called a masterpiece in fact), please do not hesitate to open my notes and see the footprints of the pioneer, one in ten thousand possible, if it really helps, it is the best.
